# FDIC-FAILED-BANKS
	This was a quick descriptive analysis of the total number of failed banks in Southern America by city-state and year; Using Power Bi for the visualization. 
	 Based on the analysis, I recommend that startup company (Banks) looking for new location to establish a branch, should avoid city and state with highest failed bank number.
ETL was done on Power Bi using gata data via web link.
